# The GOAL of the project is to clone the game, "I saw her standing there",
# whenever we see a feature-mismatch between the two, we can treat it
# as a bug and work on fixing the bug.
#
# Below is a list of bugs, not exhaustive 
# (and probably ever growing as per the onlooker)
# After finishing a bug, we can put an X in the [].
