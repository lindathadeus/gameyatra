#The GOAL of the project is to clone the game, "I saw her standing there",
#whenever we see a feature-mismatch between the two, we can treat it
#as a bug and work on fixing the bug.
#
#Below is a list of bugs, not exhaustive 
#(and probably ever growing as per the onlooker)
#After finishing each bug, we can put a cross in the box
