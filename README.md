This is a project to learn about game development.

# Idea
The game is a smaller clone of this game https://armorgames.com/play/13213/i-saw-her-standing-there. We create the project, patch by patch, based on our visual observation of the original game. Each patch can be considered as a code block with a feature or bug fix. Over time, these patches come together to form the complete game, making the learning process practical and easy to follow.
